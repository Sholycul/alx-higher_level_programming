# SSH

This repository contains information about SSH (Secure Shell) and how to use it for secure communication between two devices over a network.

## What is SSH?

SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure communication between two devices over an insecure network. It provides a secure way to access and transfer files between devices, as well as execute commands on remote machines.

## How to use SSH

To use SSH, you need to have an SSH client installed on your device. You can use the `ssh` command in the terminal to connect to a remote machine using SSH. Here is the basic syntax for connecting to a remote machine:

```
ssh username@remote_host
```

Replace `username` with your username on the remote machine and `remote_host` with the IP address or domain name of the remote machine.

## SSH Key Authentication

SSH also supports key-based authentication, which is more secure than password-based authentication. To use key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine and add the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote machine.
